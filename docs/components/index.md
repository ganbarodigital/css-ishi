# Components

## Introduction

<p class="leader">Components (or microformats - take your pick) are non-standard HTML markup that can really make your content standout. They're reusable structures that you can quickly use in your content or site templates.</p>

Wherever possible, the markup used is semantic. To make that possible, some of these components are powered behind the scenes by JavaScript. [Follow these instructions if you use any of these components]({% include pageurl.html name='javascript' %}).

## Content Components

* There are [callouts]({% include pageurl.html name='callouts' %}) and [panels]({% include pageurl.html name='panels' %}) to draw attention to a point that you want to get across.
* Want to entice the reader to click a link to get started? Use a [call to action]({% include pageurl.html name='callstoaction' %}).
* Need to draw attention to a paragraph? There are a few [types]({% include pageurl.html name='paragraph-types' %}) to choose from.

## Navigation Components

* [Navbars]({% include pageurl.html name='navbars' %}) are horizontal menus that you can put anywhere on your page.
* Want previous / next buttons on your page, just like there are at the top and bottom of this page? Use a [pageflow nav section]({% include pageurl.html name='pageflow-navigation' %}).

# Welcome To Ishi

Ishi is a simple responsive CSS toolkit from [Ganbaro Digital](https://ganbarodigital.com). It has [clearly defined goals](goals.html). It draws [heavy inspiration](inspirations.html) from existing toolkits and leading content websites.

It is [licensed under the MIT license](license.html). [Contributions](contributing.html) are welcome.

## Why Use Ishi?

The benefits of using Ishi include:

* [beautiful typography](typography.html) for easy reading whether you're on the smallest or the largest of devices
* [convenient components](components.html) to enhance your content even further
* [semantic markup](structure.html) that describes your content and not your layout, based on HTML5 tags
* [utility classes](utilities.html) when you need to be pragmatic
* [multiple layouts](layouts.html) that you can easily switch between, based on CSS 3's flexbox (#nogrid!)
* [themes](themes.html) for easily changing fonts and colors without having to change everything else

Ishi is written in SASS. You can import it into your own SASS ruleset, and quickly build on top of it to get the look and feel that you want for your own websites and content.

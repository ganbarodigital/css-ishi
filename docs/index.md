# Welcome To Ishi

Ishi is a simple CSS toolkit from [Ganbaro Digital](https://ganbarodigital.com).

## Goals

1. High-quality presentation wherever you're reading.

   Whatever we want to show you, we believe that we have only one chance to get you interested in what we have to say.

   You might be on your tablet at home over breakfast, on your smartphone on the commute to the office, on a desktop / laptop during the day, or back on your tablet or smartphone in the evening. If you can't read our website on your first visit, we don't believe that you'll switch devices and try again.

1. Markup that's separated from layout.

   Grids have rightly revolutionised how we layout websites. But all they're doing is filling the gap that has been left when we stopped using tables to do the same thing. A grid is markup that describes the layout of your content.

   The right layout for a desktop might be different to what suits reading on a smartphone.

1. A toolkit to quickly create new themes.

## How Ishi Delivers

* [Beautiful typography](typography.html) for easy reading whether you're on the smallest or the largest of devices.
* [Semantic markup](structure.html) that describes your content and not your layout.
* [Common components](components.html) to enhance your content.
* [Utility classes](utilities.html)
* [Multiple layouts](layouts.html) that you can easily switch between.
* [Themes](themes.html)

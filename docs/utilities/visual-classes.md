## Borders

Ishi provides several classes that you can use to set a border around your own markup.

Each of these classes:

* sets border style and color
* sets a suitable margin below for improved readability

### On Their Own

Use the `border-block` CSS class for a simple, square border.

<div class="block border-block">
    <p>This is a `div` with the `border-block` CSS class added.</p>
</div>

Use the `border-panel` CSS class for a rounded border. This is the same border that the panel component uses.

<div class="block border-panel">
    <p>This is a `div` with the `border-panel` CSS class added.</p>
</div>

Use the `border-blockquote` CSS class for a border applied only on the left side of your div. This is the same border that the blockquote element uses.

<div class="block border-blockquote">
    <p>This is a `div` with the `border-blockquote` CSS class added.</p>
</div>

Use the `border-callout` CSS class for a border applied only on the left side of your div. This is the same border that the callout component uses.

<div class="block border-callout">
    <p>This is a `div` with the `border-callout` CSS class added.</p>
</div>

### With Context Classes

## Introduction

Ishi uses SASS mixins to make it easier to keep text styles consistent. Use these in your own styles and themes to remain consistent with Ishi going forward.

## Inline Text

Inline text is any text element that can appear inside a paragraph.

Here's a list of the SASS mixins for inline text:

Name | Purpose
-----|--------
`util-inline-text-pad()` | Padding to increase readability of styles that have a solid background color (e.g. `<code>`)
`util-inline-text-radius()` | Subtle border radius to increase visual appeal of styles that have a solid background color (e.g. `<code>`)

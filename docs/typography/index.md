# Typography

## In This Section

Ishi delivers beautiful typography designed to make your content look good and (visually at least) a pleasure to read.

* [Basic text](text.html) - headings and paragraphs - are styled for document-like content.
* [Lists](lists.html) come in the usual bullet-point and indexed styles, and are styled for report-like content.
* [Links](links.html) are styled to be instantly recognisable.
* [Preformatted text, inline code, keyboard instructions](pre.html) also get the treatment.
* [Syntax-highlighted code](code.html) is styled to avoid disrupting the rest of your page.

{{ ishi.content('flow') }}

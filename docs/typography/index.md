# Typography

## Introduction

Ishi delivers beautiful typography designed to make your content look good and (visually at least) a pleasure to read.

* [Basic text]({% include pageurl.html name='text' %}) - headings and paragraphs - are styled for document-like content.
* [Lists]({% include pageurl.html name='lists' %}) come in the usual bullet-point and indexed styles, and are styled for report-like content.
* [Links]({% include pageurl.html name='links' %}) are styled to be instantly recognisable.
* [Preformatted text, inline code, keyboard instructions]({% include pageurl.html name='pre' %}) also get the treatment.

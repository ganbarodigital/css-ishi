# The Default Table

## Introduction

Ishi provides default styling for HTML tables. You don't need to add any classes.

## Example Tables

This is a basic table with minimal content.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Column 1</th>
            <th>Column 2</th>
            <th>Column 3</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 1, column 1</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 2</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 2, column 1</td>
            <td>Row 2, column 2</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 3, column 1</td>
            <td>Row 3, column 2</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 4, column 1</td>
            <td>Row 4, column 2</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 3</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

This is the same table, with an added footer.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Column 1</th>
            <th>Column 2</th>
            <th>Column 3</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 1, column 1</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 2</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 2, column 1</td>
            <td>Row 2, column 2</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 3, column 1</td>
            <td>Row 3, column 2</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 4, column 1</td>
            <td>Row 4, column 2</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 3</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
        <tr>
            <td>Total 1</td>
            <td>Total 2</td>
            <td>Total 3</td>
        </tr>
    </tfoot>

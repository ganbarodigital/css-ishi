## What's In This Section?

There are several key ideas at the heart of Ishi.

* [Many devices, one site](one-site.html) is our main site architecture.
* [Device groups](device-groups.html) are how we go about supporting mobile, tablet, laptop / desktop responsively.
* [A layered toolkit](layered-toolkit.html) is our strategy for making Ishi as flexible as possible whilst still being easy to customise.

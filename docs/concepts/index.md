# Concepts

## What's In This Section?

There are several key ideas at the heart of Ishi.

* [Many devices, one site]({% include pageurl.html name='one-site' %}) is our main site architecture.
* [Device groups]({% include pageurl.html name='device-groups' %}) are how we go about supporting mobile, tablet, laptop / desktop responsively.
* [A layered toolkit]({% include pageurl.html name='layered-toolkit' %}) is our strategy for making Ishi as flexible as possible whilst still being easy to customise.

#### This Color Is Usable, Just Not Great

You can use `social-blogger` as a background color behind normal paragraphs, and as a background color for large headings. It meets the WCAG 2.0 AA standard. But other colors will be even better!

Background Color | `#f57d00`
- Luminosity | 146.63 (dull)
- sRGB Relative Luminosity | 0.341
Contrast Ratio `#000` / `#f57d00` | 7.816
- If We Used `#fff` / `#f57d00` | 2.687
Good Background Choice For Headings? | yes

#### Notes

1. To determine color luminosity (black, white, or gray), we calculate the color's luma value from the [YIQ color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIQ), using [a formula originally by Brian Suda](https://24ways.org/2010/calculating-color-contrast/).
1. The sRGB relative luminosity is calculated using the [WCAG 2.0 formula](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#relativeluminancedef). It maps each RGB component onto a non-linear gamma 2.2 curve.
1. The contrast ratio is calculated using the [WCAG 2.0 definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#contrast-ratiodef). We share [the concerns that WebAIM has](http://webaim.org/blog/wcag-2-1-feedback/) about the WCAG 2.0 formula. There are some circumstances where it favours a foreground color that looks very low-contrast on modern screens.
1. We think a color is a good background choice if:
  - it is WCAG 2.0 AAA Compliant with our chosen foreground color `#000` (yes), and
  - both `#000` and `#f57d00` have different luminosity (darker or brighter) (yes), and
  - `#f57d00` isn't a mid-range color when converted to grayscale (no)

### WCAG 2.0

How does `social-blogger` (with `#000` as our chosen foreground color) do against the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)?

Compliance Level | When | Value

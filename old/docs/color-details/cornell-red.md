Want to use `cornell-red` as a background color in your theme? We have a mixin that will set both the `background-color` and `color` properties for you:

```scss
.headline {
    @include cornell-red-bg();

#### This Color Is Usable, Just Not Great

You can use `cornell-red` as a background color behind normal paragraphs, and as a background color for large headings. It meets the WCAG 2.0 AA standard. But other colors will be even better!

### Color Properties

Here's our automated analysis of `cornell-red`, when used as a background color:

Property | Value
---------|------
Foreground Color | `#fff`
- Luminosity | 255 (bright)
- sRGB Relative Luminosity | 1
Background Color | `#b31b1b`
- Luminosity | 72.448 (dark)
- sRGB Relative Luminosity | 0.104
Contrast Ratio `#fff` / `#b31b1b` | 6.798
- If We Used `#000` / `#b31b1b` | 3.089
Good Background Choice For Headings? | yes
Good Background Choice For Long Content? | no

#### Notes

1. To determine color luminosity (black, white, or gray), we calculate the color's luma value from the [YIQ color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIQ), using [a formula originally by Brian Suda](https://24ways.org/2010/calculating-color-contrast/).
1. The sRGB relative luminosity is calculated using the [WCAG 2.0 formula](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#relativeluminancedef). It maps each RGB component onto a non-linear gamma 2.2 curve.
1. The contrast ratio is calculated using the [WCAG 2.0 definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#contrast-ratiodef). We share [the concerns that WebAIM has](http://webaim.org/blog/wcag-2-1-feedback/) about the WCAG 2.0 formula. There are some circumstances where it favours a foreground color that looks very low-contrast on modern screens.
1. We think a color is a good background choice if:
  - it is WCAG 2.0 AAA Compliant with our chosen foreground color `#fff` (no), and
  - both `#fff` and `#b31b1b` have different luminosity (darker or brighter) (yes), and
  - `#b31b1b` isn't a mid-range color when converted to grayscale (yes)

### WCAG 2.0

How does `cornell-red` (with `#fff` as our chosen foreground color) do against the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)?

Compliance Level | When | Value

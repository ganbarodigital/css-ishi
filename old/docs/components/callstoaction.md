# Calls To Action

## Introduction

### What Are Calls To Action For?

A _call to action_ is a stylised link. Use a call to action when you want to encourage the reader to do something.

## A Basic Call To Action

A basic call to action is an `<a>` link with the `calltoaction` class:

<a class="calltoaction" href="../getting-started.html">Get Started With Ishi Today!</a>

### Adding Extra Context

Add any one of the [context classes](../utilities/context-classes.html) to your `calltoaction` `<a>` to change the colour of the call to action's border and default background.

<a class="calltoaction calltoaction--attention" href="../getting-started.html">Get Started With Ishi Today!</a>

<a class="calltoaction calltoaction--primary" href="../getting-started.html">Get Started With Ishi Today!</a>

<a class="calltoaction calltoaction--secondary" href="../getting-started.html">Get Started With Ishi Today!</a>

# Site Menu

## Introduction

Use a _sitemenu_ when you want to hide your site's main menu behind a "Menu <i class="fa fa-bars fa-lg"></i>" like the one at the top of this page.

## Markup

A _sitemenu_ has two components:

* the menu itself, as a `nav` element, and
* the "Menu" button that will toggle hiding and showing the sitemenu
